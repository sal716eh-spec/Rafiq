/* rafiq-judge — a Cloudflare Worker that holds the TypeSafe key and answers
   a fixed set of questions for the site:

     POST {kind:'vocab',   arabic, glosses:[...], answer}  → {ok}
     POST {kind:'produce', english, model, answer}         → {ok, err}
     POST {kind:'build',   english, model, answer}         → {ok, order}
     POST {kind:'rewrite', task, original, model, answer}  → {ok, changes, err}
     POST {kind:'prompt',  task, model, answer}            → {done, grammar, err}

   Values are TypeSafe probabilities (done is a 0–2 score); the page decides
   what to do with them. The questions are built here, not in the browser, so
